## Summary 

Created another expense tracker, but utilizing React this time around. The intent to recreate this application was to introduce me to the React framework. After building this application I got a better understanding how powerful React can be especially with the addition of Bootstrap. Looking back I am definitely excited to dive deeper into React and other frameworks as well.
